About Dataset
The THE World University Rankings provide the definitive list of the worldâ€™s best universities, with an emphasis on the research mission. It is the only global university league table to judge research-intensive universities across all of their core missions: teaching (the learning environment); research (volume, income and reputation); citations (research influence); industry income (knowledge transfer) and international outlook (staff, students and research). It uses 13 carefully calibrated performance indicators to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons. The overall list is accompanied by 11 subject-specific rankings.

Original data, as well as ranking methodology described per each year, is available on the official website www.timeshighereducation.com
